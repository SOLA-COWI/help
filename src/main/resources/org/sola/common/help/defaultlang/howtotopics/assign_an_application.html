<h1>Assign an Application<br>
</h1>

<p>To assign an application, you must first ensure the Paid flag on the Fees 
    tab is checked by editing the application or setting the Paid flag when 
    lodging a new application. After you have edited an application, you will 
    need to select Refresh on the Dashboard before the updated application 
    details are displayed. </p>

<p>Select the paid application from the Unassigned applications list and click 
    the Assign tool. This will open the Application Assignment screen (a 
    variation of the Application Details screen). Click the Assign button to 
    assign the application. When the Assign action is complete, you will be 
    returned to the Dashboard and the assigned application will appear in the 
    Assigned applications list. </p><br>

<p>Typically users will only be able to assign applications to themselves (i.e. they will 
    be able to pull work), however team leaders will be able to manage the workload of 
    their teams and will be able to assign and reassign applications to other users. </p>
