        <p>The known issues for the SOLA Alpha Release are:</p>

        <ol style="text-align: justify;">

           <li>
                Attaching large digital files (e.g. approx. 5Mb or larger) can cause the SOLA 
                application to stop responding to user input and requires a restart of the 
                application.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Attempting to open and view moderately sized documents that have been 
                successfully attached (e.g. approx. 2Mb &#8211; 5 Mb) can cause the SOLA application 
                to stop responding until the document has been completely downloaded. This can 
                take between 10 to 90 seconds. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Only a small selection of screen labels and messages currently have 
                Italian translations. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Services do not get updated with the status Started when the Start action
                is used on the Application Details Services tab. This does not prevent the
                user from processing the service.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Removing / extinguishing rights (e.g. ownership rights) does not make the 
                right historic.<br>
            </li>
           
        </ol>
