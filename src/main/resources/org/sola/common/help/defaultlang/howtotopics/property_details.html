<h1>Property Details</h1>

<p>The Property Details screen allows you to create new property records or edit the details 
    of an existing property. You can access the Property Details screen by starting a property
    related service such as New Digital Title (used to create new property records), 
    Register New Ownership, Register Mortgage, Vary Lease, etc, from the Application 
    Details Service tab.

<p>A property in the context of the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM - draft ISO standard
    19152) is a Basic Administrative Unit (a.k.a. BA Unit). In a title registration system, it is 
    the title. In line with LADM, the BA Unit is uniquely identifiable 
    and links parcels to their applicable Rights, Restrictions and/or Responsibilities 
    (a.k.a. RRR) for the purposes of registration with a land administration agency. 
    Details that can be captured for a property are: <br></p>
<ul>

  <li>Parcels &#8211; The area(s) of land that define the extent of a property. Parcels 
      can be spatially defined and/or textually described. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Rights, Restrictions & Responsibilities &#8211; The rights, restrictions or 
      responsibilities the right holder(s) are accorded in relation to the parcels 
      represented by the property.  These could be ownership rights, lease rights, 
      mortgage rights, mining rights, access rights, servitudes, building restrictions, 
      land use restrictions, caveats, etc.  <br>
  </li>
  <li>Ownership &#8211; Typically the primary right for a property is the right of ownership. 
      Properties can have one or many owners each with a share in the property that may be 
      implicitly defined or undivided. Note that changes in ownership are captured using the 
      Ownership right on the Rights / Restrictions tab of the Property Details screen. 
      The Ownership tab is provided on the Property Details screen to quickly view ownership 
      history. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Notations &#8211; Short comments recorded when changes are made to the property that 
      provide a succinct history of the changes. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Property history &#8211; Shows the list of parent properties (if any) that are superseded by the property (and whose objects the property will inherit) and the list of child properties (if any) that the property is superseded by 
      (to which the property’s objects will be linked to) when the property is terminated. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Map &#8211; Provides the SOLA Map Viewer along with the Current property cadastre objects 
      layer to allow you to identify the location of the property and its parcels and objects (if any). Recording this information can help to identify and distinguish the location of property’s objects, both current and pending
      <br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications with Multiple Properties</h2>

<p>SOLA allows more than one property to be associated to an application. In this situation, 
    the Select Property screen is displayed when you start a property related service allowing 
    you to select the appropriate property to work on by double clicking.</p> <br>

<h2>Approving a Property Change</h2>

<p>Changes made to the property such as the addition or removal of rights remain pending 
    until the application is approved. You can approve the application by completing all 
    services on the application and approving the application using the Approve tool 
    in the Application Details toolbar.</p>

<h2>Terminate a Property</h2>

<p>When a property has been superseded by new properties/titles and these new properties have inherited 
    its object, then it has to be terminated. You can terminate the superseded property by linking all its objects to the new properties and terminating it, once the new properties change 
    their status from pending to current, using the Terminate tool in the Property Details toolbar.</p> <br>
