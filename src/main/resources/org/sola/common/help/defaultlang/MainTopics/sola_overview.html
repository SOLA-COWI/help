        <h1>Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA)</h1>

        <p>Started in June 2010, Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA) is a 3 year trust fund project funded by the Government of Finland. 
            The NRC Land Tenure team of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) initiated and now manages SOLA as a measure 
            that will benefit security of tenure for the poor. Through the development and re-use of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS), it aims 
            to make computerized cadastre and registration systems more affordable and more sustainable in developing countries </p>

        <p>
            The initial SOLA software represents international best practice 
            for land administration and is based on the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM), 
            currently published as a Draft International Standard by the International Organization 
            for Standardization (ISO), as ISO 19152.
        </p>

        <p> The initial software development effort was completed on February 2012 
            and pilot implementations of SOLA began in Samoa and Nepal in March 
            2012 and in Ghana customization work began in May 2012. </p>

        <p> Customization of the initial generic SOLA software is needed to cater for the laws, 
            existing records and practices of each country where SOLA is implemented as well as to accommodate 
            the specific responsibilities of the land administration agency that will use SOLA in support of their 
            cadastre and registration functions. To assist the customization process, local software developers 
            have been recruited and trained so they can undertake the required customizations, 
            support the pilot implementations and maintain the software. 
            The local software development teams are expected to become key members of the SOLA user and developer community. </p>

        <h2>SOLA Release Candidate</h2>

        <p>The SOLA Release Candidate (v1.1) updates the SOLA Customization Release (v1.0) with over 180 bug fixes and enhancements, 
            many of which have been identified during pilot customization efforts. The Release Candidate includes all the functionality 
            required to support generic cadastre and registration operations in a typical land office including:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Subdividing and merging parcels </li>
            <li>Cadastre correction/redefinition </li>
            <li>Orthophoto support</li>
            <li>Recording of property rights, restrictions and ownership details</li>
            <li>Printing of certificates (registration, ownership, title)
            <li>Case management functions including requisition, rejection, 
                withdrawal and approval / registration of proposed changes</li>
            <li>Application processing reporting</li>
            <li>Document management</li>
            <li>Validation of proposed changes using configurable, automated business rules</li>
            <li>History of actions for an application and its services</li>
            <li>User administration (via SOLA Admin)</li>
            <li>Configurable role based access control and business rule definition (via SOLA Admin)</li>

        </ul>

        <p>The SOLA Release Candidate is the starting point for country specific 
            software customization prior to its implementation as an operational 
            system within land offices in a country. Although it has been subject 
            to software testing and review, the SOLA software will continue to 
            be refined and made more robust by the FAO Rome based software 
            development team over 2012. A comprehensive system of version 
            control has been implemented involving the three pilot implementations
            and so improvements in the central version of the SOLA software will
            be available to the SOLA customization software development teams in
            the three pilot countries.  </p>
        
        <p>For this reason, the SOLA Team would like to invite members of the 
            SOLA Community, in particular developers working in the land 
            administration area and potential users of SOLA, to review and 
            comment on this Customization Release of the SOLA software. Your 
            comments can be sent via email to neil.pullar@fao.org and the team 
            will endeavour to respond to your feedback.</p>

        <p>
            The SOLA Release Candidate is available in three forms;</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">a) The Release Candidate Web Start Applications, 
            demonstrating the functions of SOLA Desktop and SOLA Admin. These applications are 
            deployed using Java Web Start technology. Users must have internet access and a local
            installation of the Java SE Runtime Environment 7 to run the web start applications. 
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">b) A Developer Setup Bundle that includes instructions on how to 
            install and configure the development tools used for SOLA, along with the source code, database 
            backup and supporting configuration files. The SOLA Developer Setup Bundle also includes instructions 
            on how to upgrade earlier releases of the SOLA Developers Bundle to use the Release Candidate. 
            The Developer Setup Bundle can be obtained from http://www.flossola.org/downloads</p>
         
        
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">c) As source code from Github (https://github.com/SOLA-FAO). To use this source code 
            you will need sign up for a Github account and install Git. The Github help provides informative tutorials on how 
            to achieve these tasks.  Note that SOLA uses 10 Git repositories. For details on how to manage these repositories, 
            see the README.txt in the code repository. These repositories are under constant development by the SOLA Development Team. 
            To obtain the source code for the Release Candidate, checkout the candidate-release tag or the release branch.</p>
        
        <p>The SOLA Release Candidate Web Start applications and the Developer 
            Setup Bundle are available for download from 
            http://www.flossola.org/downloads. Documentation supporting the 
            Customization Release are also available from 
            http://www.flossola.org/documents/release-candidate.</p>

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>

        <p>Customization of SOLA for Samoa and Nepal began in March 2012 and production implementation at these pilot sites is due in November 2012.  
            Ghana customizations began in May 2012 and production implementation for the Ghana pilot is expected in late 2012 or early 2013. 
            Following the completion of the pilot implementations, a General Availability (GA) Release of SOLA will be published along with supporting documentation.</p><br>
