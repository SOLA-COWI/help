        <h1>Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA)</h1>

        <p>Started in June 2010, Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA) is a 3 year trust fund project funded by the Government of Finland. 
            The NRC Land Tenure team of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) initiated and now manages SOLA as a measure 
            that will benefit security of tenure for the poor. Through the development and re-use of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS), it aims 
            to make computerized cadastre and registration systems more affordable and more sustainable in developing countries </p>

        <p>
            The initial SOLA software will represent international best practice
            for land administration and is based on the Land Administration Domain
            Model (LADM), currently published as a Draft International Standard by
            the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), as ISO 19152. </p>

        <p> The initial software development effort was completed on February 2012 
            and pilot implementations of SOLA began in Samoa and Nepal in March 
            2012 and in Ghana customization work will begin in May 2012. </p>

        <p> Customization of the initial generic SOLA software is needed to 
            cater for the laws, existing records and practices of each country 
            where SOLA is implemented as well as to accommodate the specific 
            responsibilities of the land administration agency that will use 
            SOLA in support of their cadastre and registration functions. To 
            assist the customization process, local software developers have 
            been recruited and trained so they can undertake the required 
            customizations, support the pilot implementations and maintain 
            the software. The local software development teams are expected to
            become key members of the SOLA user and developer community. </p>

        <h2>SOLA Customization Release</h2>

        <p>The SOLA Customization Release (v1.0) provides additional functionality 
            and significant improvements in software usability from the 
            previous two releases (Development Snapshot and Alpha). It includes
            all the functionality required to support generic cadastre and 
            registration operations in a typical land office including:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Subdividing and merging parcels </li>
            <li>Cadastre correction/redefinition </li>
            <li>Recording of property rights, restrictions and ownership details</li>
            <li>Printing of certificates (registration, ownership, title)
            <li>Case management functions including requisition, rejection, 
                withdrawal and approval / registration of proposed changes</li>
            <li>Application processing reporting</li>
            <li>Validation of proposed changes using configurable, automated business rules</li>
            <li>History of actions for an application and its services</li>
            <li>User administration (via SOLA Admin)</li>
            <li>Configurable role based access control and business rule definition (via SOLA Admin)</li>

        </ul>

        <p>The Customization Release is the starting point for country specific 
            software customization prior to its implementation as an operational 
            system within land offices in a country. Although it has been subject 
            to software testing and review, the SOLA software will continue to 
            be refined and made more robust by the FAO Rome based software 
            development team over 2012. A comprehensive system of version 
            control has been implemented involving the three pilot implementations
            and so improvements in the central version of the SOLA software will
            be available to the SOLA customization software development teams in
            the three pilot countries.  </p>
        
        <p>For this reason, the SOLA Team would like to invite members of the 
            SOLA Community, in particular developers working in the land 
            administration area and potential users of SOLA, to review and 
            comment on this Customization Release of the SOLA software. Your 
            comments can be sent via email to neil.pullar@fao.org and the team 
            will endeavour to respond to your feedback.</p>

        <p>
            The Customization Release is available in two forms;</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">a) The Customization Release Web Start Applications, 
            demonstrating the functions of SOLA Desktop and SOLA Admin. These applications are
            deployed using Java Web Start technology. Users must have internet access and a
            local installation of the Java SE Runtime Environment 7 to run the web start
            applications.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">b) A Developers Setup Bundle that includes
            instructions on how to install and configure the development tools 
            used for SOLA, along with the source code, database backup and 
            supporting configuration files. The SOLA Developers Setup Bundle 
            also includes instructions on how to upgrade earlier releases of the
            SOLA Development Bundle to use the Customization Release. </p>

        <p>The Customization Release Web Start applications and the Developer 
            Setup Bundle are available for download from 
            http://www.flossola.org/downloads. Documentation supporting the 
            Customization Release are also available from 
            http://www.flossola.org/documents/customization-release.</p>

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>

        <p>Pilot Implementations in Ghana, Nepal and Samoa has started as of March 2012 
            and SOLA support to the pilot implementations will continue
            until May 2013. The first 6 months will involve the customization of
            the SOLA software to meet the needs of each pilot country by local
            teams of software developers. Following customization, the local
            software developers will support the implementation of the customized
            SOLA software in these countries.</p><br>
