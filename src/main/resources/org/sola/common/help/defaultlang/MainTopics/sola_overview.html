        <h1>Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA)</h1>

        <p>Started in June 2010, SOLA is a 3 year trust fund project funded by
            the Government of Finland. The NRC Land Tenure team of the Food and Agriculture
            Organization of the United Nations (FAO) initiated and and now manages SOLA as a
            measure that will benefit security of tenure for the poor. 
            Through the development and re-use of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS),
            it aims to make computerized cadastre and registration
            systems more affordable and more sustainable in developing countries. </p>

        <p>
            The initial SOLA software will represent international best practice
            for land administration and is based on the Land Administration Domain
            Model (LADM), currently published as a Draft International Standard by
            the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), as ISO 19152. </p>

        <p>Once the initial software development effort is complete, pilot
            implementations of SOLA will be undertaken in Samoa, Nepal and Ghana.
            Before SOLA can be implemented in any country it must be customized to
            cater for the laws, existing records and practices of that country as
            well as accommodate the specific responsibilities of the land
            administration agency that will use SOLA to perform cadastre and
            registration functions. To assist the customization process, local
            software developers will be recruited and trained so they can undertake
            the required customizations, support the pilot implementations and
            maintain the software. The local software development teams are
            expected to become key members of the SOLA user and developer
            community. </p>

        <h2>SOLA Alpha Release</h2>

        <p>The SOLA Development Snapshot was released in late August 2011 to demonstrate
            the software architecture of SOLA and the SOLA development environment.
            It contained limited land administration functionality and was not
            suitable for the day-to-day operations of a land office with cadastre
            and registration responsibilities. </p>

        <p>The SOLA Alpha Release extends the Development Snapshot providing functionality
            for core front and back office land processing covering both cadastre and
            registration functions. This release includes support for:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Subdividing and merging parcels </li>
            <li>Recording of property rights, restrictions and ownership details</li>
            <li>Case management functions including requisition, annulment and 
                approval / registration of proposed changes</li>
            <li>Validation of proposed changes using configurable, automated business rules</li>
            <li>History of actions for an application and its services</li>
            <li>Look and Feel User Interface templates to simplify user interface customization</li>
            <li>User administration (via SOLA Admin)</li>
            <li>Configurable roles based access control (via SOLA Admin)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Similar to the Development Snapshot, the Alpha Release is not yet ready for general use.
            The SOLA Team is busy completing outstanding functionality, defect fixing and preparing
            documentation to support customization and on-going maintenance and administration
            activities. However, the SOLA Team would like to invite members of the SOLA Community,
            in particular developers working in the land administration area and potential users of
            SOLA, to review and comment on the Alpha Release. Your comments can be sent via email
            to neil.pullar@fao.org and the team will endeavor to respond to your feedback. </p>

        <p>
            The Alpha Release is available in two forms;</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">a) The Alpha Release Web Start Applications, 
            demonstrating the functions of SOLA Desktop and SOLA Admin. These applications are
            deployed using Java Web Start technology. Users must have internet access and a
            local installation of the Java SE Runtime Environment 7 to run the web start
            applications.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">b) A Developers Bundle that includes a
            pre-configured development environment for SOLA, the source code for
            the Alpha Release and a virtual server hosting the SOLA
            PostgreSQL database populated with test data. </p>

        <p>The Alpha Release Web Start applications and the Developers Bundle are available for download
            from http://www.flossola.org/downloads. Documentation supporting the 
            Development Snapshot is also available from 
            http://www.flossola.org/documents/alpha-release.</p>

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>

        <p>Another release for SOLA (version 1.0) is planned for early March 2012 and that release
            will be used as the basis for customization in the pilot countries. That release will
            further extend the functionality of the Alpha Release to include: </p>

        <ul>

            <li>Information searches &amp; enquiries </li>
            <li>Management reporting</li>
            <li>Additional cadastre change services</li>
            <li>Additional registration services</li>
            <li>Additional system administration functions</li>
            <li>Documentation to support customization and on-going maintenance and administration activities</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Pilot Implementations in Ghana, Nepal and Samoa will start from March 2012 
            and SOLA support to the pilot implementations will continue
            until May 2013. The first 6 months will involve the customization of
            the SOLA software to meet the needs of each pilot country by local
            teams of software developers. Following customization, the local
            software developers will support the implementation of the customized
            SOLA software in these countries.</p><br>
