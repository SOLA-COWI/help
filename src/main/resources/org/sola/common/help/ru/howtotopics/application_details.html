        <h1>Application Details</h1>

        <p>The Application Details screen allows you to enter the details for a new application and/or 
            edit the details of an existing application. To create a new application, the Application 
            Details screen can be accessed from the Applications &gt; New Applications menu or selecting  
            <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/03_new_application_icon.png">.</p>

        <p> To edit an application, select the application in the assigned or unassigned application 
            lists on the Dashboard and choose Edit. If the application is not displayed in the application 
            lists, use the Search Application screen to locate it and click the Edit button. 
            This will open the Application Details screen allowing you to edit the application details
            and save changes
        </p><br>

        <img style="width: 600px; height: 362px;" alt="" src="../images/18_application_details.png"><br>

        <p>An application represents a bundle of services that will be undertaken by the land 
            administration agency, typically in response to a customer request. Each service may 
            result in changes to property information and/or associated rights. Details that can be 
            captured for an application are: <br></p>

        <ul>

            <li>Agent &#8211; An individual or a firm that is filing the application with the land 
                administration agency. Agent details are optional. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Contact Person &#8211; The individual that can be contacted should the details of 
                the application require further elaboration or clarification. 
                A contact person must be identified with every application and will 
                usually be the applicant.  <br></li>
            <li>Services &#8211; These broadly identify the actions the land administration agency 
                will undertake for the application. It is expected that each land administration 
                agency will configure services based around their existing practices.  At least 
                one service must be added to each application. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Property &#8211; The property or properties affected by the application. Property 
                details are optional for new applications, but may be required prior to starting 
                services depending on the services selected for the application. Note that SOLA Desktop
                does not currently provide a Property Search facility, however the Object Information Tool
                can be used to find existing property identifiers. <br></li>
            <li>Documents &#8211; The legal or other documents that explain and/or justify the reasons
                for changing cadastre and registration records. Scanned images of documents should be attached
                to the application for easy reference. Document details are optional; however there are
                certain document types that are expected to accompany various services.  The Required
                Document Types list on the Documents tab identifies the types of documents that should
                be included with the application given the services that have been selected. <br></li>
            <li>Fees &#8211; Identifies the fees payable to the land administration agency before the 
                application can proceed. This fee is currently based on the service and property 
                information recorded for the application and will be customized to satisfy specific
                land administration agency needs. The fee is automatically calculated when a new 
                application is lodged. To perform fee calculation prior to lodgement, use the Calculate
                fee tool in the Application Details toolbar. You can also print a receipt for the 
                application using the Print receipt tool. Note that SOLA does not currently provide 
                cashier functionality.  For this reason a Paid checkbox is included on this tab to 
                allow you to flag the application fee as paid in order to assign the application. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Map Points &#8211; Provides the SOLA Map Viewer along with the Locate Application 
                tools to allow you to identify the approximate location of the application. 
                Recording this information can help to identify other applications in close proximity
                to the new application that could have a bearing on the new application or vice 
                versa. Optional.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Validations &#8211; Displays the results of the automated business rules executed 
                when you choose to manually validate the application using the Validate action. 
                Validation is only available after the application has been lodged.<br>
            </li>
            <li>History &#8211; Displays the history of actions applied to the 
                and its services. The actions that can be applied to applications and
                services are described below. History details are only available after
                the application has been lodged.<br>
            </li>
        </ul>
