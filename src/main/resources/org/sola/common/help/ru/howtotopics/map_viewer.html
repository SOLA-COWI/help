        <h1>SOLA Map Viewer<br>
        </h1>

        <p>The SOLA Map Viewer allows you to navigate and interact with the
            geospatial data managed by SOLA. It can be accessed from the Map &gt;
            Ctrl + Open Map menu or selecting <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/05_world_icon.png"></p><br>
        <p><img style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" alt="" src="../images/10_map_viewer.png"></p>

        <p>The SOLA Map Viewer includes a toolbar for navigating and querying the map and two tabs: 
            one Table of Contents that can be used to control the layers displayed on the map 
            and one Find tab that can be used to find parcels in the map
            The tools provided for the SOLA Map Viewer are:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Zoom to Extent <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/11_full_extent_icon.png"></li>
            <li>Zoom out <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/12_zoom_out_icon.png"></li>
            <li>Zoom in <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/13_zoom_in_icon.png"></li>
            <li>Pan <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/14_pan_icon.png"></li>
            <li>Information Tool <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/15_information_tool_icon.png"><br>
            </li>
            <li>Print <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/50_print_icon.jpg"></li>

        </ul>

        <p>The SOLA Map Viewer can also support additional map tools for
            editing and related spatial tasks (e.g. Locate Application). These
            tools are described in the relevant How To sections</p>

        <h2>Map Scale and Location</h2>

        <p>The scale of the map can be controlled using the Zoom in, Zoom out and Zoom to extent tools. The desired scale can also be 
            entered directly into the Scale text box in the bottom right of the map.A scale bar is displayed to help determine distances
            on the map. Note that due to variations in screen resolution, the scale bar is indicative only and it should not be used to 
            obtain accurate measurements from the map. 
            As you pass the mouse over the map you will see map coordinates displayed in the bottom left corner under the Layers and Find tabs. 
            This information can be used to determine coordinate locations on the map.
        </p>

        <h2>Layers</h2>

        <p>The Layers tab identifies the layers of geospatial data that can be displayed in the map. You can show or hide these layers by 
            checking or clearing the checkbox next to the layer name
            <br>
            <img style="width: 519px; height: 329px;" alt="" src="../images/layers.jpg">
            <br>
            By clicking the triangle beside each layer name you can also see the symbology used to illustrate the geospatial data at different map scales.
            For example, when the map scale is below 2,500, Place names will be illustrated with a large red square. Between 2,500 and 90,000 a medium red
            square is used and above 90,000 a small red square. Using the map scale to control the layer symbology ensures the map does not become overly 
            crowded with detail which might otherwise impair navigation or comprehension of the information displayed by the map.  
            <br>
            The default layers available for SOLA include
        <ul>

            <li>Applications	Points that indicate the approximate location of applications that have been lodged in SOLA. 
                Application points can be created using the Map Points tab when capturing details for a new application. </li>
            <li>Place names	Illustrates the approximate location of notable geographic features such as towns, headlands and bays. </li>
            <li>Survey controls	Illustrates the location of survey control (i.e. geodetic) marks. </li>
            <li>Roads	Shows the location of roads.</li> 
            <li>Pending Parcels	New parcels that have been created by a survey subdivision or amalgamation. These parcels remain pending 
                until the application that created them is approved. </li>
            <li>Parcels	Illustrates the location of current parcels.</li>
            <li>Historic Parcels with Current Titles	This layer shows parcels that have been subdivided or amalgamated into new parcels, but still have current title references. </li>
            <li>Parcel Nodes	Illustrates the location of current parcel nodes.</li> 
            <li>Orthophoto	Aerial photograph(s) that have been corrected for lens distortion, 
                camera tilt and topography to ensure they have a uniform scale and are suitable for map display.</li>

        </ul> 
        Note that the layers can be reconfigured to match those required by the land administration agency

    </p>

    <h2>Find</h2>

    <p>
        You can use the Find tab to perform spatial searches to quickly locate parcels or other geospatial features in the map. 
        To use the Find, select the type of geospatial feature to search in the Search By drop down and start typing in the field provided.
        Once you have entered enough characters (between 1 and 3), the search will begin listing values that match the search criteria. 
        To view one of the results, double click the result value in the result list and the map will zoom to the location of the selected feature and highlight it.
        <br>
        <img style="width: 519px; height: 329px;" alt="" src="../images/find.jpg">

    <ul>

        <li>Number	Enter the appellation for a parcel (e.g. parcel/lot and/or plan number) to locate a parcel. This search will only work with parcels 
            that have a spatial definition. Requires at least 3 characters to be entered.</li> 
        <li>Property number	Enter the title / folio reference for a property to locate the parcel for the property. 
            This search will only work if the property is linked to a parcel with a spatial definition. Requires at least 3 characters to be entered.</li>
        <li>Property owner	Enter the name of a current property owner to locate a parcel for the property. This search will only work if the property is 
            linked to a parcel with a spatial definition. Requires at least 3 characters to be entered.</li>

    </ul>
    Note that the spatial searches can be reconfigured to match those required by the land administration agency.
</p> 

<h2>Information Tool</h2>

<p>The Information Tool can be used to query geospatial features such as
    parcels, survey control, place names, roads, villages, etc. As geospatial features are often
    in close proximity or overlap, the Information Tool displays details
    for all features immediately surrounding the selected location.
    Click the appropriate tab to see details for the various layer features.
    Note that the tabs and the details displayed by the Information Tool can be reconfigured to match those required by the land administration agency
</p><br>

<h2>Print out Tool</h2>

<p>The Print Out Tool can be used to print out the visualised map in a pdf file format.
    You can turn layers on/off if you want or don't want some of them to be in printout.
    Then you can choose a layout: A3, A4, A5 but there can be defined as many as needed.
    In the same dialog you can choose a scale. An estimated scale is already calculated from the map.<br>
    Click the Print button to generate a document containing the image of the map. Using the Report Viewer, 
    you can save the print in several formats including PDF, DOCX and HTML or print a hard copy For PDF format a PDF Viewer must be installed in the system.
    <br>
    Notice that everywhere in the software there is a map there is a Print button as well and that when printing â€“ additionally - a service of type cadastrePrint 
    is registered in the service table and also marked as completed (if the map window is started by an application, this service is attached to the application, 
    completed Map Print service ) 
    Note that the print templates (i.e. A3, A4 and A5) can be can be reconfigured to match those required by the land administration agency.
