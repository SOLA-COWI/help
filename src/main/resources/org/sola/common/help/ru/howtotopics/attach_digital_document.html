<p>The Remote disk view displays documents that have been placed in a
specific network file system location e.g. The output folder configured
for a network attached scanner. Thumbnail previews are supported for
standard image formats (png, tiff, jpg) as well as PDF. Once you have
chosen the document to attach, click the Attach button. A paperclip icon will
be displayed in the documents list in the Documents tab to indicate the documents that have
attachments. Finally you need to save the application for the
attachment to remain linked to the application.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 14px; width: 1042px;">Note that moderate to large files can cause issues 
    with the attachment process. For details, refer to Known Issues. </p>
